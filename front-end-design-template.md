Knowledge of Creation
> A DnD character information and design tool
By: Kevin Patterson

## Application Description
> Knowledge of Creation is a web app that is going to use a 5th edition D&D api to provide users with information about the selected class, race, or stat that they wish to learn about. The goal of the app in its current form is to allow players to retrieve basic information about the different choices that they will face when creating a character. Having a web app with basic information makes players less reliant on a book, and makes retrieval much easier as well. Since stats are tied into both racial and class traits it is possible that I will create a link to stats info if pressed.

### Web Service(s) Used
> I will be using the D&D 5e API found at [http://www.dnd5eapi.co/](http://www.dnd5eapi.co/) for all the calls in this web app. All calls to the API will be GET calls and they will return all information requested back to me in a promise that I will format and present to the user. There is even a possibility for cross referenced calls, and filtered searches, but for now I will not be implementing them.

## Top-Level Design/Layout
> I plan to make each labled portion of the three grids a button that, depending on which section is chosen, a previously hidden display will appear and relay the relevant information, then that box can either be closed (rehidden) or another option can be selected. I plan to make all the options for information availible to the user upon entry to the site.
